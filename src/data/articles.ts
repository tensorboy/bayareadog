    content: `The San Francisco Bay Area is a paradise for dogs who love the beach. With miles of coastline stretching from Marin County down through San Mateo, there are dozens of spots where your four-legged friend can run free on the sand. But not all beaches are created equal — some require leashes, others have seasonal restrictions, and a few are true off-leash havens year-round.

This comprehensive guide covers every off-leash dog beach in the Bay Area, complete with parking tips, water safety notes, and insider advice from local dog owners who visit these beaches every week.

## Fort Funston — The Crown Jewel

Fort Funston sits at the southwestern tip of San Francisco, perched on sandy cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It is widely considered the best off-leash dog beach in the entire Bay Area, and for good reason.

The beach itself is massive — nearly half a mile of wide, flat sand that stretches between dramatic sandstone bluffs. Dogs can run completely free here, and on any given weekend morning you will see dozens of dogs sprinting, wrestling, and splashing in the shallow surf. The energy is infectious. Even the most reserved dogs tend to come out of their shells at Fort Funston.

**Getting there:** Take Skyline Boulevard (Highway 35) south past the zoo. The main parking lot is on the west side of the road. On weekends, arrive before 9 AM to guarantee a spot. After 10 AM, the lot fills up and you may need to park along Skyline Boulevard and walk in.

**The trails:** Besides the beach, Fort Funston has a network of sandy trails along the clifftops. These trails offer stunning views of the ocean, the Marin Headlands to the north, and sometimes even the Farallon Islands on clear days. The Sunset Trail loop is about 1.5 miles and is mostly flat, making it perfect for senior dogs or puppies who are not ready for the beach stairs.

**Water safety:** The surf at Fort Funston can be powerful, especially during winter swells. Rip currents are common. Most dogs instinctively stay in the shallow water, but if your dog is a strong swimmer who charges into waves, keep a close eye on them. There are no lifeguards here.

**The stairs:** Getting down to the beach requires navigating a long, steep sand ladder — about 200 steps carved into the cliff face. It is not suitable for dogs with mobility issues. The sand shifts regularly, so the stairs can be uneven. Some dog owners carry small dogs down in backpacks.

**Pro tips from locals:**
- Bring water. There are no fountains at the beach level.
- The morning fog burns off by 11 AM most days. Afternoon visits mean warmer sand and more sun.
- Watch for hang gliders launching from the cliff top — they can startle some dogs.
- The battery bunkers at the top are fun to explore but watch for broken glass inside.

## Crissy Field — Urban Beach Perfection

Crissy Field is San Francisco's other premier off-leash dog area, and it could not be more different from Fort Funston. Located along the northern waterfront of the Presidio, Crissy Field offers a long, flat beach with calm water and postcard views of the Golden Gate Bridge.

The off-leash area includes the East Beach section and the adjacent marsh trails. The water here is San Francisco Bay rather than the open Pacific, which means gentler waves and warmer temperatures. Many dogs who would not dare enter the surf at Fort Funston are perfectly happy wading at Crissy Field.

**Getting there:** Enter the Presidio from Marina Boulevard and follow Mason Street north to the Crissy Field parking areas. There are several lots. The East Beach lot is closest to the off-leash area.

**What makes it special:** The combination of beach access, marsh trails, and the stunning Golden Gate Bridge backdrop makes Crissy Field one of the most scenic dog walks anywhere in the United States. On clear days, you can see Alcatraz, Angel Island, and the Marin Headlands all from the beach.

**Important rules:** Dogs must be under voice control at all times. The Wildlife Protection Area (the marsh and dunes) is off-limits to dogs to protect the snowy plover habitat. Stay on designated trails.

## Ocean Beach — The Wild One

Ocean Beach is San Francisco's longest stretch of coastline — over 3.5 miles of sand facing the Pacific. Dog policies vary by section:

- **North of Stairwell 21** (near the Cliff House): On-leash only year-round.
- **South of Stairwell 21 to Sloat Boulevard**: Off-leash allowed under voice control.
- **South of Sloat to Fort Funston**: Off-leash allowed, and this section connects to Fort Funston's beach at low tide.

The surf here is the most dangerous in the Bay Area. Signs warn against swimming, and the rip currents have caught even experienced swimmers off guard. For dogs, the safest approach is to let them play in the wet sand and shallow foam rather than venturing into the waves.

**Parking:** Street parking along the Great Highway is available but can be limited on weekends. There is a large parking lot at Sloat Boulevard.

## Point Isabel Regional Shoreline — East Bay's Best

Point Isabel in Richmond is the largest off-leash dog park in the Bay Area at 23 acres. While it is technically a shoreline park rather than a beach, the waterfront access and sheer size make it a must-visit for Bay Area dog owners.

The park features grassy fields, paved walking paths, and a muddy but beloved shoreline where dogs wade in the bay. On any given day, you will find 100+ dogs running around this park.

**The cafe:** Sit & Stay Cafe is located right in the park. You can get coffee and snacks while your dog plays. Few dog parks anywhere can match this combination of off-leash space and human amenities.

**Getting there:** Take the Central Avenue exit from I-580 and follow the signs. The parking lot is large but fills up on weekend mornings.

**What to know:** The shoreline is muddy. If your dog goes in the water, they will need a towel (or a bath) afterward. The water quality in this part of the bay can vary, so check the EBMUD water quality reports if you are concerned.

## Pacifica State Beach (Linda Mar)

Pacifica State Beach is a popular surf beach about 15 minutes south of San Francisco. Dogs are allowed off-leash on the north end of the beach (the section closest to the parking lot).

The beach has a more mellow vibe than Fort Funston. It is smaller and attracts fewer dogs, which makes it a better choice for shy or reactive dogs who need more space. The surf is moderate and there is a nice grassy area behind the beach for picnicking.

**Getting there:** Take Highway 1 south from San Francisco. The main parking lot is at Linda Mar Boulevard. Parking is metered ($2/hour).

## Rodeo Beach — Marin's Hidden Gem

Rodeo Beach in the Marin Headlands is a small, dramatic beach tucked into a steep valley. Dogs are allowed off-leash on the beach and the surrounding trails, which climb up to spectacular views of the Pacific and the Golden Gate Bridge.

The beach itself is made of dark sand and smooth pebbles rather than the fine sand you find at most Bay Area beaches. The water is cold and rough — more of a "dogs run on the beach" spot than a swimming beach.

**Getting there:** Cross the Golden Gate Bridge and take the Alexander Avenue exit. Follow signs to the Marin Headlands and Rodeo Beach. The road winds through a dramatic one-lane tunnel.

## Baker Beach — On-Leash with a View

Baker Beach is worth mentioning even though dogs must be on-leash here. The views of the Golden Gate Bridge from the beach are arguably the best in the city. The south end of Baker Beach is also a popular nude beach, which adds a uniquely San Francisco flavor to your dog walk.

## Seasonal Tips for Bay Area Beach Dogs

**Spring (March-May):** Wildflower season in the headlands. Trails are green and beautiful. Watch for foxtails beginning in late April — these barbed grass seeds can embed in your dog's paws, ears, and nose.

**Summer (June-August):** San Francisco beaches are often foggy and cold in summer. East Bay and South Bay tend to be warmer. Always bring layers for yourself even if it looks sunny when you leave home.

**Fall (September-November):** The best beach weather in San Francisco. Indian summer brings warm, clear days. This is prime time for beach visits.

**Winter (December-February):** Big winter swells make the surf dangerous. Stick to calmer spots like Crissy Field or Point Isabel. Rainy days mean fewer crowds but muddier trails.

## Safety Essentials for Every Beach Trip

1. **Fresh water** — Always bring drinking water for your dog. Salt water causes vomiting and diarrhea.
2. **Leash in the car** — Even at off-leash beaches, keep a leash handy for the parking lot.
3. **Recall training** — If your dog does not reliably come when called, they should not be off-leash at the beach. Practice in enclosed spaces first.
4. **Poop bags** — This should go without saying, but always clean up after your dog.
5. **Towels** — At least one for the dog, one for the car seats.
6. **First aid** — Tweezers for foxtails, styptic powder for broken nails, and your vet's phone number.

## The Verdict

For pure off-leash beach joy, **Fort Funston** remains the king. For scenic beauty and calmer water, **Crissy Field** is unbeatable. For East Bay residents, **Point Isabel** is the daily go-to. And for a quieter alternative, **Pacifica State Beach** delivers a more relaxed experience.

The Bay Area has more dog-friendly beaches than almost any metro area in the country. Take advantage of them — your dog will thank you with the kind of pure, unfiltered happiness that only a good beach run can produce.`,

    description: "A comprehensive guide to buying raw dog food in the Bay Area, from 99 Ranch Market to specialty pet stores.",
    date: "2026-01-20",
    category: "eat",

    content: `Feeding your dog a raw diet in the Bay Area is easier than you might think. San Francisco and the surrounding cities have an incredible selection of sources for raw meat, bones, and organs — from budget-friendly Asian supermarkets to premium pet food delivery services.

This guide will walk you through every option, from the cheapest chicken backs at 99 Ranch to the fanciest grass-fed tripe at boutique pet stores. Whether you are just starting raw feeding or you are a veteran looking for new sources, you will find something useful here.

## Understanding Raw Dog Food (BARF Diet)

The BARF (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) diet follows an 80-10-10 ratio:
- **80% muscle meat** (chicken thighs, beef, turkey, pork, etc.)
- **10% raw meaty bones** (chicken backs, necks, duck frames)
- **5% liver** (beef, chicken, or pork liver)
- **5% other organs** (kidney, spleen, heart technically counts as muscle meat)

Optional additions include eggs, sardines, and a small amount of vegetables or fruit.

## Budget Option: Asian Supermarkets

### 99 Ranch Market

99 Ranch is the single best source for affordable raw dog food ingredients in the Bay Area. With locations in Daly City, Foster City, Cupertino, Milpitas, Richmond, and Newark, most Bay Area dog owners have one within a reasonable drive.

**What to buy at 99 Ranch:**
- **Chicken backs** — $0.99-1.29/lb. This is your primary bone source. Buy in bulk.
- **Chicken livers** — $1.49/lb. Essential for the liver component.
- **Chicken gizzards and hearts** — $1.99/lb. Hearts count as muscle meat.
- **Pork neck bones** — $1.49/lb. Great meaty bone option for larger dogs.
- **Duck frames** — $1.99/lb when available. Excellent bone-to-meat ratio.
- **Beef tripe (green or bleached)** — $2.49/lb. Packed with probiotics when green.
- **Chicken feet** — $1.29/lb. Natural glucosamine source for joint health.
- **Whole fish (mackerel, sardines)** — $2-4/lb. Omega-3 rich.

**Pro tip:** The Daly City 99 Ranch tends to have the best selection of offal and organ meats. Visit on weekday mornings when stock is fresh. Ask the butcher counter for cases of chicken backs — they often have bulk boxes in the back that are not on the shelf.

**Monthly cost estimate (50 lb dog):** $60-80/month.

### Marina Supermarket (San Francisco)

Marina Supermarket on Clement Street has a solid selection of organ meats and bones. Their pork kidneys and beef liver are usually well-priced and fresh.

### Sunset Super (San Francisco)

Another Sunset District gem with good prices on chicken frames and organ meats. They carry green tripe when available.

### H Mart (Various Locations)

Korean supermarkets like H Mart carry excellent quality beef bones, ox tails, and tripe. Prices are higher than 99 Ranch but the quality is often superior. The H Mart in San Jose has one of the best butcher selections.

### Ranch 99 vs. Regular Grocery Stores

For comparison, here are typical prices at a regular grocery store like Safeway or Whole Foods versus 99 Ranch:

| Item | 99 Ranch | Safeway | Whole Foods |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Chicken backs | $0.99/lb | $1.99/lb | N/A |
| Chicken liver | $1.49/lb | $2.99/lb | $4.99/lb |
| Beef heart | $2.99/lb | $5.99/lb | $7.99/lb |
| Ground beef | $3.99/lb | $5.99/lb | $8.99/lb |

The savings are significant. Over a year, feeding a 50 lb dog from 99 Ranch versus Whole Foods could save you $1,000+.

## Mid-Range Option: Specialty Pet Stores

### Marin Raw (San Rafael)

Marin Raw is a dedicated raw dog food store in San Rafael that has become a Bay Area institution. They carry:
- Pre-made raw patties (various proteins)
- Whole prey model options
- Green tripe (the real stuff, not bleached)
- Raw meaty bones from local farms
- Supplements and balancing powders

Their staff is incredibly knowledgeable about raw feeding and can help you customize a diet for your dog's specific needs. Prices are higher than DIY from the supermarket, but the convenience and quality are worth it for many dog owners.

**Monthly cost estimate (50 lb dog):** $120-160/month.

### Pet Food Express (Multiple Locations)

Pet Food Express carries several commercial raw food brands:
- **Primal Pet Foods** (based in San Francisco!) — Nuggets, patties, and grinds
- **Stella & Chewy's** — Freeze-dried raw patties
- **Northwest Naturals** — Raw frozen diets
- **Steve's Real Food** — Raw frozen nuggets

These are convenient but expensive. A 50 lb dog eating exclusively commercial raw food will cost $200-300+/month.

### George (San Francisco)

George pet store in the Inner Richmond has a curated selection of raw food brands and knowledgeable staff who can help you transition your dog to raw.

## Premium Option: Delivery Services

### Raw Paws Pet Food

Online delivery with a wide selection of raw proteins, bones, and organs. They ship frozen with dry ice. Good option if you want variety beyond what local stores carry (venison, rabbit, goat, etc.).

### We Feed Raw

Subscription-based raw food delivery. Pre-portioned patties based on your dog's weight. Convenient but premium-priced at about $250-350/month for a 50 lb dog.

## DIY Raw Feeding: Getting Started

If you are new to raw feeding, here is a simple starter plan using 99 Ranch ingredients:

### Week 1-2: Introduction
Start with one protein (chicken is easiest):
- Chicken thighs (bone-in, skin-on) — This gives both meat and bone
- Serve at 2-3% of body weight per day
- Split into two meals

### Week 3-4: Add Organs
- Continue chicken thighs as the base
- Add chicken liver (small amounts — too much causes loose stool)
- Add chicken hearts (a nutrient-dense muscle meat)

### Month 2: Expand Proteins
- Rotate between chicken, pork, and beef
- Add beef liver and kidney
- Add chicken backs as a dedicated bone source
- Begin adding eggs (2-3 per week for a 50 lb dog)

### Month 3: Full Diet
Your dog should now be eating:
- Chicken thighs, beef chunks, pork shoulder (muscle meat)
- Chicken backs, pork neck bones (bones)
- Beef liver, chicken liver (liver)
- Beef kidney, chicken gizzards (organs)
- Eggs, sardines (supplements)

## Important Supplements

Even a well-balanced raw diet may need supplementation:

- **Fish oil** — For omega-3 fatty acids. Norwegian salmon oil is a popular choice. About 1,000 mg EPA/DHA per 30 lbs of body weight daily.
- **Vitamin E** — When feeding fish oil, add vitamin E to prevent oxidation. 100 IU per 30 lbs daily.
- **Kelp powder** — For iodine and trace minerals. A pinch per meal.
- **Balance IT Canine** — If you are concerned about balancing, this supplement fills nutritional gaps.

## Food Safety for Humans

Raw meat handling requires basic food safety:
- Store raw dog food separately from human food
- Wash bowls after every meal with hot soapy water
- Thaw in the refrigerator, not on the counter
- Wash your hands after handling raw meat
- Clean prep surfaces with diluted bleach or vinegar solution

## Cost Comparison: Raw vs. Kibble vs. Commercial Raw

For a 50 lb dog eating 2% body weight daily (1 lb/day):

| Feeding Method | Monthly Cost |
|---------------|-------------|
| Budget kibble | $30-50 |
| Premium kibble | $60-90 |
| DIY raw (99 Ranch) | $60-80 |
| DIY raw (mixed sources) | $100-150 |
| Commercial raw (Primal) | $200-300 |
| Delivery service | $250-350 |

DIY raw from Asian supermarkets is competitive with premium kibble pricing while providing what many owners consider a nutritionally superior diet.

## Bay Area Raw Feeding Community

The Bay Area has an active raw feeding community:
- **Facebook groups**: Search for "Bay Area Raw Feeding Dogs" — several active groups with 5,000+ members share tips, recipes, and bulk buying opportunities.
- **Meetups**: Raw feeding dog owners often organize bulk buying co-ops to get better prices on larger orders.

## Final Thoughts

The Bay Area is one of the best places in the country to feed your dog a raw diet. Between the incredible Asian supermarket selection, dedicated raw pet stores like Marin Raw, and a supportive community of experienced raw feeders, you have everything you need to give your dog the diet nature intended.

Start simple, introduce proteins slowly, and do not be afraid to ask for help. Your dog's improved coat, energy, and dental health will be all the evidence you need that you made the right choice.`,

    content: `Oakland is one of the most dog-friendly cities in the Bay Area when it comes to dining out. With its warm weather, diverse food scene, and relaxed attitude, Oakland offers dozens of restaurants where your dog is not just tolerated — they are genuinely welcomed.

This guide covers the best dog-friendly restaurants with outdoor patios across Oakland, from hip Temescal eateries to waterfront spots at Jack London Square.

## 1. The Dock at Linden Street

**Neighborhood:** Jack London Square
**Cuisine:** Seafood / American
**Price:** $$

The Dock is the quintessential dog-friendly Oakland restaurant. Located right on the waterfront at Jack London Square, their massive outdoor patio offers views of the estuary and plenty of space for dogs to relax under the table. The staff routinely brings water bowls without being asked.

**What to order:** The fish tacos are outstanding, and their weekend brunch draws a loyal crowd. The craft beer selection is solid, featuring several local East Bay breweries.

**Dog notes:** Large patio with shade umbrellas. Dogs of all sizes welcome. Water bowls available. Can get crowded on weekend evenings — arrive before 6 PM for the best patio seats.

## 2. Drake's Dealership

**Neighborhood:** Uptown Oakland
**Cuisine:** American / Pizza / Beer Garden
**Price:** $$

Drake's Dealership is a converted auto dealership turned beer garden and restaurant, and it is one of the best dog hangouts in Oakland. The outdoor area is massive — think communal picnic tables, string lights, and a relaxed atmosphere where dogs are everywhere.

**What to order:** Drake's is a brewery first, so start with a Denogginizer or 1500. The wood-fired pizzas are the star of the food menu. Try the Apocalypse IPA if you like hops.

**Dog notes:** The beer garden is the main event here. Dogs must stay in the outdoor area. It is very dog-friendly — you will see 10+ dogs on any weekend visit. The open layout gives dogs plenty of space.

## 3. Homeroom

**Neighborhood:** Temescal
**Cuisine:** Mac and Cheese
**Price:** $$

Homeroom's entire menu is mac and cheese, and it is glorious. They have a small but charming front patio where dogs are welcome. The casual vibe makes it feel perfectly natural to have your pup sitting next to you while you devour a bowl of truffle mac.

**What to order:** The Gilroy Garlic Mac is a Bay Area classic. For something richer, go with the Sriracha Mac. They also have excellent gluten-free options.

**Dog notes:** Small front patio with 4-5 tables. First come, first served. Best for small to medium dogs given the tight space. No dog water provided but staff is happy to bring a bowl if you ask.

## 4. Temescal Brewing

**Neighborhood:** Temescal
**Cuisine:** Brewery / Food Trucks
**Price:** $-$$

Temescal Brewing has one of the most dog-friendly setups in Oakland. Their outdoor area is spacious, rotating food trucks provide the eats, and the vibe is pure relaxed East Bay energy. Dogs are so common here that it functions as an informal dog park with beer.

**What to order:** Their Temescal Pils is crisp and refreshing. The rotating food trucks mean you get different cuisine every week — check their Instagram for the schedule.

**Dog notes:** Extremely dog-friendly. Off-leash dogs are not uncommon in the outdoor area (though officially they should be leashed). Bring your own water bowl.

## 5. Lake Chalet

**Neighborhood:** Lake Merritt
**Cuisine:** American / Seafood
**Price:** $$$

Lake Chalet sits right on the shore of Lake Merritt in a beautiful historic boathouse. Their waterfront patio is stunning, especially at sunset. Dogs are welcome on the outdoor terrace.

**What to order:** The oysters are fresh and well-priced for the area. The Lake Chalet burger is a reliable choice. Brunch on weekends is popular but expect a wait.

**Dog notes:** The patio faces the lake, providing a calming environment. Staff brings water for dogs. Not ideal for very excitable dogs as the patio is close to the walking path where joggers and cyclists pass frequently.

## 6. Forge Pizza

**Neighborhood:** Jack London Square / Rockridge
**Cuisine:** Pizza / Italian
**Price:** $$

Forge has multiple Oakland locations, and both have dog-friendly outdoor seating. The pizzas are wood-fired, the salads are excellent, and the atmosphere is casual enough that nobody bats an eye at a dog under the table.

**What to order:** The Margherita pizza is classic perfection. The Brussels sprouts appetizer is surprisingly good. Local beers on tap.

**Dog notes:** Both locations have outdoor seating. The Jack London Square location has more space. Dogs should be well-behaved as tables are moderately close together.

## 7. Standard Fare

**Neighborhood:** West Berkeley (technically Berkeley, but Oakland-adjacent)
**Cuisine:** American / Brunch
**Price:** $$

Standard Fare is a beautiful restaurant in a converted warehouse space with a gorgeous outdoor patio. While technically in West Berkeley, it is right on the Oakland border and draws heavily from Oakland's food scene.

**What to order:** The brunch is the main draw. Their fried chicken sandwich is legendary. The pastries from their in-house bakery are excellent.

**Dog notes:** Spacious patio with plenty of shade. Dogs must be leashed and under the table. Water bowls available on request.

## 8. Souley Vegan

**Neighborhood:** Jack London Square
**Cuisine:** Vegan / Soul Food
**Price:** $$

Souley Vegan proves that vegan soul food is a thing, and it is delicious. Their outdoor seating area on Broadway is dog-friendly, and the portions are generous enough that you might want to share a bite of cornbread with your pup (it is dog-safe!).

**What to order:** The Big Macs (their version of vegan burgers) are incredible. The mac and cheese is creamy and rich despite being entirely plant-based. The soul bowl is a crowd-pleaser.

**Dog notes:** Sidewalk patio seating. Best for calm dogs who can handle street-side dining. The staff is very welcoming to dogs.

## 9. Portal

**Neighborhood:** Temescal
**Cuisine:** Beer Garden / Bar Food
**Price:** $$

Portal is a beer bar with a huge outdoor space that feels like a backyard party. Dogs are a regular sight here, and the atmosphere is as casual as it gets.

**What to order:** Extensive craft beer and cocktail menu. The food is elevated bar fare — the smash burgers and fries are excellent.

**Dog notes:** Large outdoor space. Very dog-friendly. Can get loud in the evenings — sensitive dogs may prefer daytime visits.

## 10. Viridian

**Neighborhood:** Jack London Square
**Cuisine:** California / Mediterranean
**Price:** $$$

Viridian is one of the newer additions to Oakland's dining scene, and their outdoor patio overlooking the Jack London Square waterfront is beautiful. Dogs are welcome on the patio, and the upscale-casual atmosphere makes it a nice option for a special dinner out with your pup.

**What to order:** The seasonal menu changes frequently. The seafood is always excellent, and the wine list features many California producers.

**Dog notes:** Upscale patio — best for well-behaved dogs who can settle quietly. Water and treats sometimes offered for dogs.

## Tips for Dining Out with Your Dog in Oakland

1. **Call ahead on busy nights** — Even dog-friendly restaurants may have limited patio seating.
2. **Bring a mat or blanket** — Gives your dog a comfortable spot under the table and signals to staff that you are a considerate dog owner.
3. **Feed your dog first** — A dog with a full belly is a calm dining companion.
4. **Bring treats** — Reward calm behavior under the table.
5. **Know your dog** — If your dog barks at other dogs, pulls toward passersby, or cannot settle, outdoor dining may be stressful for everyone.
6. **Tip well** — Dog-friendly policies exist because restaurants choose to welcome dogs. Show your appreciation.

## Oakland's Dog-Friendly Dining Culture

What makes Oakland special for dog owners is the genuine warmth toward dogs. Unlike some cities where "dog-friendly" means "we grudgingly tolerate your dog on the patio," Oakland restaurants actively embrace canine customers. Staff members will often crouch down to say hello to your dog, and many restaurants keep a stash of dog treats behind the bar.

This culture did not happen by accident. Oakland's strong community ethos, its emphasis on outdoor living, and the simple fact that a huge percentage of Oakland residents are dog owners have all contributed to making this one of the best cities in America for dining out with your dog.

So leash up, pick a restaurant from this list, and enjoy an Oakland meal with your best friend by your side.`,

    title: "Fort Funston Dog Beach: The Complete Guide",
    description: "Everything you need to know about visiting Fort Funston with your dog — trails, parking, safety tips, and seasonal advice.",
    date: "2026-02-10",

    content: `Fort Funston is the most beloved off-leash dog destination in San Francisco, and possibly the entire Bay Area. Located on the southwestern edge of the city, this former military battery sits atop dramatic 200-foot sand cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Below, a wide sandy beach stretches for nearly half a mile — and dogs run free here every day of the year.

If you have a dog in the Bay Area and you have not been to Fort Funston, this guide will tell you everything you need to know for your first visit. And if you are a regular, you might still learn a few things.

## History of Fort Funston

Fort Funston is named after Frederick Funston, a US Army general who played a key role in the response to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. During World War II, the site was part of the coastal defense system, with massive gun batteries positioned to protect San Francisco Bay from naval attack. You can still see the concrete bunkers and battery ruins along the clifftop trails.

After the military decommissioned the site, it became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) in 1972. The off-leash dog policy has been in place for decades, though it has been the subject of occasional controversy as the National Park Service has periodically proposed leash requirements.

## Getting There

**Address:** Fort Funston, Skyline Blvd (Highway 35), San Francisco, CA

**By car:** Take Skyline Boulevard (Highway 35) south past the San Francisco Zoo. Fort Funston is on the west (ocean) side of the road. The main parking lot entrance is well-marked.

**Parking:** The main lot has approximately 60 spaces. It fills up quickly:
- **Weekday mornings:** Easy to find parking
- **Weekday afternoons:** Usually available
- **Weekend 8-9 AM:** Good spots available
- **Weekend 10 AM+:** Lot is full. Park along Skyline Boulevard (legal and common)
- **Holiday weekends:** Arrive before 9 AM or accept a longer walk from street parking

**By transit:** Muni bus #57 stops at Skyline and John Muir Drive, about a 10-minute walk from the parking lot. It is a workable but infrequent route.

## The Trails

Fort Funston has several distinct trail areas:

### Sunset Trail (Main Loop)
- **Distance:** 1.5 miles loop
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Surface:** Sand, dirt, some paved sections
- **Highlights:** Clifftop ocean views, hang glider launch area, battery ruins

This is the main trail that most visitors walk. It follows the cliff edge with spectacular Pacific views, passes the hang glider launch platform (watching the gliders soar is mesmerizing), and loops back through coastal scrub. The trail is mostly flat with a few gentle hills.

### Beach Trail (Sand Ladder)
- **Distance:** 0.3 miles one way (down to beach)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate to hard (steep stairs)
- **Highlights:** Direct beach access, dramatic cliff views

The sand ladder is a long staircase carved into the cliff face. It is the primary route down to the beach. The stairs are not maintained to any particular standard — sand shifts, steps erode, and the angle can feel steep. Count on about 5-10 minutes to descend and 10-15 minutes to climb back up.

**Not suitable for:** Dogs with mobility issues, senior dogs with joint problems, very small puppies. Some owners carry small dogs in backpacks.

### Battery Davis Trail
- **Distance:** 0.5 miles one way
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Surface:** Paved
- **Highlights:** Historic gun battery, sheltered area on windy days

This paved path leads to the Battery Davis ruins. It is less crowded than the main trail and offers a windbreak on gusty days. The battery ruins are interesting to explore but watch for broken glass and graffiti paint on the concrete.

## The Beach

The Fort Funston beach is what draws most dog owners. Key facts:

- **Length:** Approximately 0.4 miles of accessible beach
- **Width:** Varies with tide. At low tide, the beach is 100+ yards wide.
- **Surface:** Fine, firm sand
- **Water:** Pacific Ocean — cold (50-55°F year-round), with variable surf
- **Off-leash:** Yes, dogs run free on the beach

### Typical Beach Day

On a weekend morning, you will see 30-50 dogs on the beach at any given time. The atmosphere is joyful — dogs sprint in packs, chase balls, splash in the surf, and dig holes. Dog owners cluster in groups, chatting while their dogs play. There is a genuine community here; regulars know each other and their dogs by name.

### Water Safety

The Pacific surf at Fort Funston ranges from gentle to powerful depending on the season:

- **Summer:** Generally calmer. Waves 2-4 feet. Most dogs can safely wade.
- **Winter:** Large swells generate 6-10+ foot waves. Strong rip currents. Keep dogs out of the water during big swells.
- **Year-round:** The water is cold. Even on warm days, hypothermia risk exists for dogs who stay in too long.

**Rip currents** are the primary danger. If your dog gets caught in a current, do NOT swim after them. Most dogs can swim out of rip currents on their own. If your dog is pulled out, call for help and keep visual contact.

## Seasonal Guide

### Spring (March-May)
The cliffs are green and wildflowers bloom along the trails. This is one of the most beautiful times to visit. Watch for **foxtails** starting in late April — these barbed grass seeds can lodge in your dog's ears, nose, eyes, and between toes. Check your dog thoroughly after every visit.

### Summer (June-August)
Fort Funston is often foggy and cold in summer (welcome to San Francisco). The fog usually burns off by noon, but morning visits can be chilly. The upside: fewer crowds on foggy mornings.

### Fall (September-November)
The best weather of the year. Warm, clear days with light winds. This is the peak season for Fort Funston visits, and weekend parking is at its worst. Come early.

### Winter (December-February)
Rainy season means the trails get muddy and the cliff edges become more dangerous (erosion is ongoing). The beach is accessible in dry weather but the surf is at its most powerful. Dramatic storm-watching from the cliffs.

## Rules and Etiquette

1. **Voice control required** — Dogs must be under voice control at all times. This means your dog comes when called, every time.
2. **Clean up after your dog** — Mutt mitt dispensers are at the trailhead. No excuses.
3. **Stay on trails near cliff edges** — Cliff collapses happen. Dogs have gone over the edge. Keep a safe distance.
4. **Respect the hang gliders** — Keep dogs away from the launch area when gliders are active.
5. **Bank swallow habitat** — Portions of the cliff face are nesting habitat for the endangered bank swallow. Signs indicate restricted areas.

## What to Bring

- Fresh water and a collapsible bowl (no drinking fountains at beach level)
- Poop bags (always bring more than you think you need)
- Towels — for the car ride home
- Treats for recall reinforcement
- Leash — for the parking lot and if your dog is not reliable off-leash
- Layers — it is almost always windier at Fort Funston than in the rest of the city

## Nearby After Your Visit

- **Java Beach Cafe** (Judah & La Playa) — 10 minutes north. Coffee and snacks with outdoor seating. Dogs welcome.
- **Andytown Coffee** (Taraval & 43rd) — Excellent coffee and their Irish Coffee is famous. Small outdoor area.
- **Safeway at Noriega** — For restocking water and snacks.

## Why Fort Funston Matters

Fort Funston is more than a dog park. It is a community gathering place, a natural landscape of striking beauty, and one of the few remaining places in an increasingly crowded city where dogs can run truly free. The combination of ocean, cliffs, trails, and sand creates an environment that dogs instinctively love.

For many San Francisco dog owners, Fort Funston is a weekly ritual — a place where the stresses of city life fall away and the simple joy of watching your dog run on the beach makes everything feel right. If you have not experienced it yet, go this weekend. You will understand.`,

    description: "A step-by-step guide to transitioning your dog to a raw diet using Bay Area resources.",
    date: "2026-01-28",
    category: "learn",
    readTime: "11 min",
    content: `Raw feeding is one of the most debated topics in the dog world, but for thousands of Bay Area dog owners, it is simply how they feed their dogs. The Bay Area is uniquely well-suited for raw feeding thanks to its diverse grocery options, active raw feeding community, and access to specialty pet stores.

This guide is specifically written for Bay Area dog owners who are curious about raw feeding and want a practical, step-by-step approach to getting started.

## Why Raw Feed?

Proponents of raw feeding point to several potential benefits:

- **Improved coat and skin** — Many owners report a shinier, healthier coat within weeks of switching to raw.
- **Better dental health** — Raw meaty bones naturally clean teeth and exercise jaw muscles.
- **Smaller, less odorous stools** — Raw-fed dogs produce significantly less waste than kibble-fed dogs.
- **Increased energy and vitality** — Many owners describe their dogs as more lively and engaged.
- **Reduced allergies** — Some dogs with food sensitivities do better on raw diets.
- **Healthier weight** — Raw diets make it easier to maintain ideal body condition.

**Important caveat:** Raw feeding is not universally endorsed by veterinarians. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) recommends against raw feeding due to concerns about bacterial contamination and nutritional balance. Always consult your veterinarian before making dietary changes, especially for puppies, senior dogs, or dogs with health conditions.

## The BARF Model: 80-10-10

The most common raw feeding model is BARF (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food), which uses an 80-10-10 ratio:

- **80% muscle meat** — Chicken thighs, beef, pork shoulder, turkey, lamb. Heart also counts as muscle meat.
- **10% raw meaty bones** — Chicken backs, necks, duck frames, pork ribs. The bone should be surrounded by meat.
- **5% liver** — Beef liver, chicken liver, pork liver. Liver is the most nutrient-dense organ.
- **5% other secreting organs** — Kidney, spleen, pancreas, brain, thymus.

## Step 1: Calculate How Much to Feed

The standard starting point is **2-3% of your dog's ideal body weight per day**, split into two meals.

| Dog Weight | 2% (less active) | 2.5% (normal) | 3% (active) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| 20 lbs | 6.4 oz/day | 8 oz/day | 9.6 oz/day |
| 40 lbs | 12.8 oz/day | 16 oz/day | 19.2 oz/day |
| 60 lbs | 19.2 oz/day | 24 oz/day | 28.8 oz/day |
| 80 lbs | 25.6 oz/day | 32 oz/day | 38.4 oz/day |

Adjust based on your dog's body condition. You should be able to feel their ribs easily but not see them prominently.

## Step 2: Source Your Ingredients (Bay Area Specific)

The Bay Area makes sourcing raw food easy. Here is your shopping list by store:

### Primary: 99 Ranch Market
- Chicken backs (bone source): $0.99-1.29/lb
- Chicken thighs, bone-in (muscle meat + bone): $1.49/lb
- Chicken liver: $1.49/lb
- Chicken hearts and gizzards: $1.99/lb
- Pork shoulder: $2.49/lb
- Duck frames: $1.99/lb (when available)

### Secondary: Your Regular Grocery Store
- Beef chuck: $4-6/lb
- Ground turkey: $3-5/lb
- Eggs: $4-6/dozen
- Canned sardines in water: $2-3/can

### Specialty: Marin Raw or Pet Food Express
- Green tripe (excellent probiotic)
- Pre-made raw blends (convenient for travel)
- Supplements

## Step 3: The Transition Plan

Do NOT switch from kibble to raw overnight. A gradual transition over 7-14 days prevents digestive upset.

### Days 1-3: Introduction
- **Morning meal:** Half portion of kibble
- **Evening meal:** Small portion of boneless chicken thigh (no bone yet)
- Observe stool quality. Some looseness is normal.

### Days 4-7: Increasing Raw
- **Morning meal:** Quarter portion of kibble
- **Evening meal:** Chicken thigh with bone-in (the bone provides calcium and firms up stool)
- If stools are loose, increase the bone content slightly.

### Days 8-10: Mostly Raw
- **Morning meal:** Raw chicken with bone
- **Evening meal:** Raw chicken with bone
- Begin adding a small piece of chicken liver (pea-sized to start)
- Drop kibble entirely.

### Days 11-14: Full Raw
- Feed chicken-based raw meals following the 80-10-10 ratio
- Gradually increase liver to target amount (5% of total diet)
- Monitor stool: white/crumbly = too much bone, dark/loose = too much organ

### Week 3+: Add New Proteins
- Add one new protein per week: beef, then pork, then turkey
- Always introduce new proteins in small amounts first
- Some dogs are sensitive to specific proteins — watch for itching or digestive changes

## Step 4: Equipment You Need

Essential:
- **Kitchen scale** — Accuracy matters. A digital scale ($15-20 at Target) is sufficient.
- **Cutting board** — Dedicated to dog food prep. Color-code it.
- **Sharp knife or kitchen shears** — For portioning chicken backs and breaking down larger pieces.
- **Storage containers** — BPA-free containers for daily portions in the fridge.
- **Freezer space** — You will buy in bulk. A small chest freezer ($150-200) pays for itself quickly.

Nice to have:
- **Meat grinder** — For making custom blends. Not necessary for most dogs.
- **Stainless steel bowls** — Easy to sanitize. Avoid plastic.

## Step 5: Food Safety for Your Family

Handling raw meat requires basic hygiene:

1. **Wash hands** thoroughly with soap and water after handling raw food.
2. **Clean bowls** after every meal with hot soapy water or run through the dishwasher.
3. **Sanitize prep surfaces** with a diluted bleach solution (1 tablespoon per gallon of water) or white vinegar.
4. **Store separately** — Keep dog food on the bottom shelf of the fridge to prevent drips onto human food.
5. **Thaw safely** — Always thaw in the refrigerator, never on the counter.

Healthy adult humans are at minimal risk from handling raw meat with proper hygiene. However, take extra precautions if household members are immunocompromised, very young, or elderly.

## Step 6: Ongoing Balance

Raw feeding does not need to be perfectly balanced at every meal. Think of it like human nutrition — you do not eat a perfectly balanced meal every time, but over a week or month, it averages out.

**Weekly targets:**
- 5-6 days of muscle meat-heavy meals
- 2-3 meals with meaty bones
- Liver 2-3 times per week (small amounts each time)
- Other organs 2-3 times per week
- Eggs 2-3 times per week
- Canned sardines once per week

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too much bone too fast** — Leads to constipation. White, crumbly stool means cut back on bone.
2. **Too much liver too fast** — Causes diarrhea. Start with tiny amounts and build up over 2 weeks.
3. **Not enough variety** — Long-term feeding of a single protein leads to nutritional gaps. Rotate at least 3-4 proteins.
4. **Forgetting supplements** — Fish oil and vitamin E should be daily additions.
5. **Not weighing food** — Eyeballing leads to overfeeding. Weigh until you can reliably estimate portions.
6. **Feeding weight-bearing bones from large animals** — Beef femurs and other large, dense bones can crack teeth. Stick to poultry bones for eating; use large bones only for recreational chewing under supervision.

## Bay Area Raw Feeding Resources

- **Marin Raw** (San Rafael) — Expert staff, full range of raw feeding supplies
- **99 Ranch Market** (multiple locations) — Budget-friendly protein and bone source
- **Bay Area Raw Feeding Facebook Groups** — Active community for advice, bulk buying, and meetups
- **Your veterinarian** — Not all vets support raw feeding, but many Bay Area vets are knowledgeable. VCA Bay Area and Sage Veterinary Centers have nutritionists on staff.
- **Balance IT** (balanceit.com) — Free tool to check nutritional balance of homemade diets

## The First Month: What to Expect

**Week 1:** Your dog may be hesitant about the new food. Some dogs dive right in; others are confused by the texture. Be patient. You may see loose stools as their digestive system adjusts.

**Week 2:** Stool should be firming up. Your dog will likely be enthusiastic about mealtimes. You may notice they drink less water — raw food is approximately 70% moisture.

**Week 3:** Coat changes begin. Many owners notice a shinier, softer coat. Stool volume decreases significantly compared to kibble.

**Week 4:** Your dog is now a raw feeder. Energy levels may increase. Teeth may look cleaner. The "raw poop" — small, firm, and minimal — becomes the new normal.

## Is Raw Feeding Right for You?

Raw feeding is not for everyone. It requires:
- Time for meal prep (15-20 minutes per week once you have a routine)
- Freezer space for bulk buying
- Comfort handling raw meat
- Willingness to learn about canine nutrition
- A slightly higher food budget than kibble (though cheaper than premium kibble from 99 Ranch)

If these sound manageable, raw feeding can be one of the most rewarding changes you make for your dog's health. The Bay Area provides everything you need to do it well.`,

    content: `The Bay Area has more dog parks per capita than almost any metro area in the United States. From tiny neighborhood parklets to sprawling regional parks, there is an incredible variety of places to take your dog for exercise and socialization.

But navigating the patchwork of leash rules can be confusing. Is that park off-leash or on-leash? Are there separate areas for small dogs? Does the park close at dusk? This guide answers all of those questions for every major dog park in the Bay Area.

## Understanding Leash Rules

**Off-leash** means your dog can be free of a leash, but they must be under voice control at all times. This means reliable recall — your dog comes when called, every time, regardless of distractions.

**On-leash** means your dog must be attached to a leash no longer than 6 feet. Retractable leashes are often technically allowed but are widely discouraged due to safety concerns.

**Mixed** means the park has both off-leash and on-leash areas, or leash rules vary by time of day or season.

## Tips for Dog Park Visits

1. **Know your dog's temperament** before going to an off-leash area. Reactive or fearful dogs may do better in quiet, on-leash settings.
2. **Watch your dog constantly.** Dog parks are not places to check your phone.
3. **Leave if there is a bully.** If a dog is being aggressive and the owner is not intervening, leave. Your dog's safety comes first.
4. **Pick up poop immediately.** Not after your walk. Immediately.
5. **Bring water.** Not all parks have working fountains.
6. **Avoid peak hours** if your dog is shy or easily overwhelmed. Early mornings and late afternoons tend to be less crowded.
7. **Keep puppies under 4 months away from dog parks.** They are not fully vaccinated and are vulnerable to parvo and other diseases.

## Finding the Right Park

Every dog is different. A dog who loves wide-open spaces will thrive at Point Isabel but may feel trapped in a small fenced park. A shy dog might do better at a smaller, quieter park like Ohlone. A water-loving dog needs Crissy Field or Point Isabel's shoreline.

Experiment with different parks to find your dog's favorite. The Bay Area has enough variety that there is a perfect park for every dog — you just need to find it.`,

## What to Expect at the Emergency Vet

### Triage
When you arrive, your dog will be assessed by a triage nurse. Cases are seen in order of severity, not arrival time. A dog having a seizure will be seen before a dog with a limp, regardless of who arrived first.

### Wait Times
Emergency vet wait times vary dramatically:
- **Life-threatening cases:** Immediate
- **Urgent but stable:** 30 minutes to 2 hours
- **Non-urgent:** 2-6 hours (yes, really)

Weekend evenings are typically the busiest times.

### Costs
Emergency vet care is expensive. Be prepared for:
- **Initial exam fee:** $150-300
- **Blood work:** $200-500
- **X-rays:** $300-600
- **Ultrasound:** $400-800
- **IV fluids and hospitalization:** $800-2,000 per day
- **Emergency surgery:** $3,000-10,000+

Most emergency hospitals require payment at the time of service. They accept credit cards and many work with CareCredit (medical financing).

### Pet Insurance
If you do not have pet insurance, consider getting it. The Bay Area's emergency vet costs are among the highest in the country. Popular options include:
- **Trupanion** — Pays vet directly, no reimbursement wait
- **Healthy Paws** — High coverage limits, good reviews
- **Lemonade Pet** — Affordable premiums, easy claims
- **ASPCA Pet Insurance** — Comprehensive coverage

## Poison Control

**ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center**
- **Phone:** (888) 426-4435
- **Cost:** $95 consultation fee (charged to your credit card)
- **Available:** 24/7, 365 days a year

This should be your first call if your dog ingests something potentially toxic. The veterinary toxicologists can advise on whether emergency treatment is needed and what to tell the emergency vet.

## Prevention is Better Than Emergency

The best emergency vet visit is the one you never need. Basic prevention:

- **Dog-proof your home** — Keep medications, cleaning products, and toxic foods out of reach
- **Leash in traffic** — Car strikes are a leading cause of emergency vet visits
- **Supervise at dog parks** — Fight injuries happen fast
- **Know your plants** — Several common Bay Area plants are toxic to dogs (oleander, sago palm, lily of the valley)
- **Regular vet checkups** — Catching problems early prevents emergencies later
- **Up-to-date vaccinations** — Parvo, distemper, and leptospirosis are all present in the Bay Area
